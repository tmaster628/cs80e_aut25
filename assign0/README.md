## CS80E Assignment 0

For this assignment, you will run the executable `list` with the command

`./list`

Unfortunately, it will crash. Step through the program in the GDB (references available on the assignment handout) and answer the question in the A0 google form.

For starters, you'll probably want to run

`gdb list`
